here are the features that can be performed:

Addition – Add two numbers together.

Subtraction – Subtract the second number from the first.

Multiplication – Multiply two numbers.

Division – Divide the first number by the second (with zero division checking).

Input Validation – Check if user input is a number, and handle invalid entries gracefully.

Error Handling – Specifically handle ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by zero.

Loop Until Exit – The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

You could say this is a simple console-based calculator with basic arithmetic features and robust error handling.
